# Improved Normalized Cut for Multi-view Clustering
Improved Normalized Cut for Multi-view Clustering (PAMI) 
This repository contains the MATLAB code for a multi-view spectral clustering approach proposed in our paper: "Improved Normalized Cut for Multi-view Clustering" accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).
Run 'demo_BBC.m' in Matlab to perform the proposed method.
